# Qwen3-TTS — Auto-Transcribe + SRT Export

> **Enhanced fork of [QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)** with two new features designed for free **Google Colab** usage:
> 1. 🎤 **Auto-transcribe** reference audio via [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (like F5-TTS)
> 2. 📥 **SRT subtitle export** from synthesized speech

---

## ✨ New Features

### 🎤 Auto-Transcribe Reference Audio
Upload a reference audio clip and click **Auto-Transcribe** — [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) automatically fills in the transcript. No more typing out reference text by hand!

- Whisper model size is selectable in the UI: `tiny` / `base` / `small` / `medium` / `large`
- Works for all 10 supported languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian)

### 📥 SRT Subtitle Export
After generating audio, click **Export SRT** to download a properly timed `.srt` subtitle file. Great for dubbing, captioning, or video production workflows.

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
First sentence of your text.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,200
Second sentence here.
```

Timing is proportional to character count per sentence relative to total audio duration.
